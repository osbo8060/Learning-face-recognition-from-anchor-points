# Learning-face-recognition-from-anchor-points

The Pre-processing folder contains the code to modify the input data to mirror the input images as well as extract the anchor points and creating the feature vectors from them

To run and see the performance of the models for face verification and face recognition, run the CNN notebook.

Face identification for the images is done by the vgg16 network
Face identification for the feature vectors is done by Metricnet

Face verification for the images is done by Metricnet
Face verification for the feature vectors is done by Metricnet

Metricnet is a simplified version of BioMetricNet.
